1. "Discrete-Simulations\analysis.py" followed by running "Discrete-Simulations\boxplot.ipynb" will generate the boxplt from the report
2. "Discrete-Simulations\TestMonteCarlo.py" followed by "Discrete-Simulations\result-analysis-MC.ipynb" will generate the Monte carlo related plots from the report
3. "Discrete-Simulations\TestSARSA.py" run with SARSA=True, or with Q-leaning=True followed by "Discrete-Simulations\results-analysis-SARSA.ipynb" or "Discrete-Simulations\results-analysis-Q.ipynb"
 will generate the SARSA and Q-learning related plots from the report, respectively.
