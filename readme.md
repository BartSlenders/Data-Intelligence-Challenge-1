1. "Discrete-Simulations\analysis.py" followed by running "Discrete-Simulations\boxplot.ipynb" will generate the boxplt from the report
2. "Discrete-Simulations\TestMonteCarlo.py" followed by "Discrete-Simulations\result-analysis-MC.ipynb" will generate the Monte carlo related plots from the report
3. "Discrete-Simulations\TestSARSA.py" run with SARSA=True followed by "Discrete-Simulations\results-analysis-SARSA.ipynb" will generate the SARSA related plots from the report.
4. "Discrete-Simulations\TestSARSA.py" run with SARSA=False followed by "Discrete-Simulations\results-analysis-Q.ipynb" will generate the Q-learning related plots from the report.
5. The notebooks for the analysis can be opened using jupyter notebook or google colab
6. The implementations for the Assignment are in the robot_configs folder: MonteCarlo.py, sarsa.py, qlearning.py
