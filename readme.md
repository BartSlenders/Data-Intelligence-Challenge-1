1. The implementations for the Assignment are in the Continuous-Simulations folder: ppo.py, reiforce.py, sac.py, run_greedy.py
2. You can run the algorithms by running files: run_reinforce.py, run_sac.py, run_ppo.py, run_greedy.py
3. Running test_ppo.py followed by running "results analysis - PPO.ipynb" will generate ppo report results
4. Running test_sac.py followed by running "results analysis - SAC.ipynb" will generate sac report results
5. Running test_reinforce.py followed by running "results analysis - REINFORCE.ipynb" will generate REINFORCE report results
6. At the bottom of each file, there are lists of values for every hyperparameter, which can be modified as the user wishes
7. Running "results analysis - comparison.ipynb" will generate comparison boxplot from report
8. The notebooks for the analysis can be opened using jupyter notebook or google colab
